File Header:

Signature (2 bytes): The first two bytes usually contain the characters 'B' and 'M' in ASCII, representing the type of file.
File Size (4 bytes): Total size of the BMP file in bytes.
Reserved (4 bytes): Reserved space.
Offset to Image Data (4 bytes): The offset, in bytes, from the beginning of the file to the bitmap data.
DIB Header:

DIB Header Size (4 bytes): The size of the DIB header (typically 40 bytes for BMP files created in Windows).
Image Width (4 bytes): Width of the bitmap in pixels.
Image Height (4 bytes): Height of the bitmap in pixels.
Number of Color Planes (2 bytes): Number of color planes being used.
Bits per Pixel (2 bytes): The number of bits per pixel, which determines the number of colors that can be represented. Common values are 1, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 32.
Compression Method (4 bytes): Specifies the compression method being used (0 for no compression).
Image Size (4 bytes): The size of the raw bitmap data.
Horizontal Resolution (4 bytes): The horizontal resolution of the image (pixels per meter).
Vertical Resolution (4 bytes): The vertical resolution of the image (pixels per meter).
Number of Colors in Palette (4 bytes): The number of colors in the color palette.
Important Colors (4 bytes): The number of important colors used, or 0 when every color is important.
Color Palette (if applicable): For images with 8 bits per pixel or less, a color palette follows the DIB header. It contains color information used in the bitmap.

Bitmap Data: This section contains the actual image pixel data.

For uncompressed bitmaps, the data is usually organized row by row, with each row padded to a multiple of 4 bytes (if needed) to ensure each row ends on a 4-byte boundary.
For compressed bitmaps, the data is compressed according to the compression method specified in the DIB header.
Padding: Each row of pixel data might be padded with extra bytes to ensure it ends on a 4-byte boundary. This padding is used to maintain alignment and optimize memory access.
